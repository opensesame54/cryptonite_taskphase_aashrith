# Pondering Paths

**Challenge 1:** Entered /pwn into the terminal 

**Challenge 2:** /challenge/run into the terminal 

**Challenge 3:** ran /challenge/run to get the correct directory, then from that, using the absolute path got the flag.

**Challenge 4:** Same as challenge 3. 

**Challenge 5:** Same as challenge 3

**Challenge 6:** used cd to make ‘/’ as the cwd, then typed in challenge/run as it is the relative path. 

**Challenge 7:** Same as challenge 6, but add another . to specify the cwd. So the command typed in will be ./challenge/run

**Challenge 8:** went to the challenge directory. Since the run file is already in challenge, executed it using ./run

**Challenge 9:** used the absolute directory /challenge/run and copied it to a file in y home directory i.e **/challenge/run ~/f**
