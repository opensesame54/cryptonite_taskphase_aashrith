# Spelling-Quiz Challenge 
In the challenge, we are given three files. The python script used for a substituiting-encryption, and the encrypted flag itself, and a long list of encrypted strings, which has the secret key for decrytion. 

Originally, we would need to write a decryption code, and pass the large list of strings in the study-guide.txt by reversing the character mapping. But since the flag is just a simple text substituition, we can use quipquip to solve for the flag. 

An  aristrocratic cipher is a cipher which uses monoalphabetic substituition, and the most common letter used in the english language is 'e'. Using quipquip to solve for the flag, we get the flag.
