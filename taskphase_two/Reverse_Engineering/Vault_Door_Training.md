# Vault Door Training Challenge 
In the challenge, we are given a java code containing the flag. Opening the code, we see a simple method that checks if the input given is the correct input or not. 

```java
public boolean checkPassword(String password) {
        return password.equals("w4rm1ng_Up_w1tH_jAv4_3808d338b46");
    }
```

flag=picoCTF{w4rm1ng_Up_w1tH_jAv4_3808d338b46}
